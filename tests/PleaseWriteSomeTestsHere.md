# Please write some Automated Tests!
Here I have converted the test folder to the Test sources root.
Automated both UI and API Scenarios
The framework is based on Page Object model
Have added the driver folder where chromedriver.exe file is kept
and have added the required dependencies to the project.

Run: 
1.The test can be run directly from the feature file in the resource/cucumber folder
2. All the tests can run using the runner class in the tests/runner folder
3. The execution extent reports can be found in the target folder
