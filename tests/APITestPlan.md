### API Testing Test Plan
## Objective
The objective of this test plan is to ensure that the API endpoints for catalog items function as expected, including validating the response status codes and data consistency.

## Scope
This test plan covers the testing of the following API endpoints:

GET /api/catalog-items to retrieve a list of catalog items.
GET /api/catalog-items/{id} to retrieve a catalog item by its ID.

## Test Environment
API Base URL: https://localhost:5099
Test Automation Framework: MSTest
Programming Language: C#
Tools: Visual Studio
Test Data: Various catalog items with valid and invalid IDs.

## Test Cases
Test Case 1: GetCatalogItems_ReturnsOkResponse
Test Scenario: Verify that the GET /api/catalog-items endpoint returns a status code of 200 (OK) when called.
Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the GET /api/catalog-items endpoint.
Verify that the response status code is 200.
Expected Result: The response status code should be 200.

Test Case 2: GetCatalogItemById_ValidId_ReturnsOk
Test Scenario: Verify that the GET /api/catalog-items/{id} endpoint returns a status code of 200 (OK) when called with a valid ID.
Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the GET /api/catalog-items/{id} endpoint with a valid ID.
Verify that the response status code is 200.
Expected Result: The response status code should be 200, indicating a successful request.

Test Case 3: GetCatalogItemById_InvalidId_ReturnsNotFound
Test Scenario: Verify that the GET /api/catalog-items/{id} endpoint returns a status code of 404 (Not Found) when called with an invalid ID.
Test Steps:
Send a GET request to the GET /api/catalog-items/{id} endpoint with an invalid ID.
Verify that the response status code is 404.
Expected Result: The response status code should be 404, indicating that the resource was not found.

## Test Execution
Test the API endpoints using the MSTest framework.
Execute each test case individually, ensuring proper setup and teardown.
Record the test results, including pass/fail status, date, and any relevant comments.

## Test Data
Prepare a set of valid and invalid catalog item IDs to be used in test cases.

## Test Reporting
Generate test reports that include details such as test case names, execution status, and any failures or issues encountered during testing.

## Defect Management
If any defects or issues are identified during testing, report them immediately to the development team using a defect tracking tool or system.

## Risks and Mitigations
Identify potential risks such as API availability, data consistency, and test environment stability. Mitigate these risks as needed.
